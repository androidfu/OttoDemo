OttoDemo
========
This project was created to demonstrate Square's Otto.  Otto is a replacement bus for Android allowing you to decouple your fragments and activities.  The original work was put together by Trey Robinson.  His project took whatever value was entered and submitted, added it to the existing value and published the result to the bus.  I added frontend error handling as well as backend error handling with an event published to the bus in the event of an error.  I added a way to reset the value utilizng the bus and I decoupled the submit button from the backend.  Oh, and I made the app much prettier ;)
